# dice-simulation
Small repo using pythong and Jupyter to calculate some dice probabilities. 

My use case is work out some suitable dice mechanices for board game design.

Calculations done:
- Probability that rolling a n dice simultaneously, you get at least one die of value i or higher. 

(n = 1 to 6), (i = 1 to n_die_faces), (die_faces = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)
